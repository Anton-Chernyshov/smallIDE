<h2>Simple Setup</h2>
<p>1. Click on <a href = "https://github.com/Anton-Chernyshov/smallIDE/blob/main/SETUP.py">setup.py</a> and download it. Then run it, and follow the setup instructions, and it should download all the required files.</p> 
<p>2. To run the script, either run '<a href = "https://github.com/Anton-Chernyshov/smallIDE/blob/main/run.py">run.py</a>', or if you cant access terminal due to permissions, '<a href = "https://github.com/Anton-Chernyshov/smallIDE/blob/main/start.bat">start.bat</a>' is an alternative working through PS.</p>
<h3>To Do / Isnt done yet</h3>
<p> ---Finish console / implement terminal into the IDE. Currently there is a terminal output, but that can only be seen on 1920x1080 screens, so i need to fix that. And this "terminal" doesnt allow for input() to be used, as it is an output box and isnt being read.</p>
<p>--- implement auto display size detection, and so the size of the boxes automatically changes for your display type. Currently if you want to change this, you need to go into <a href = "https://github.com/Anton-Chernyshov/smallIDE/blob/main/smIDEmain.pyw">smIDEmain.pyw</a> and change the displaysize and dimensions of boxes manually, but this obviously isnt ideal. </p>
